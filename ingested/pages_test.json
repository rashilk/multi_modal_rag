    "text": "PR25/034 \nIMF Executive Board Concludes the 2024 Article IV \nConsultation with Qatar  \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \nWashington, DC – February 11, 2025: On January 27, 2025, the Executive Board of the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Qatar. \nGrowth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued, with signs of strengthening \nactivities more recently. Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in \n2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project, \nand strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4¾ percent on average, \nboosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing \nreforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will \nlikely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.  \nWith lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in \n2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses \nmoderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar’s LNG production expands massively, \nboth the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share \nof GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall. \nBanks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to \n20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. \nSince the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ net short-term foreign liabilities, \nbanks’ non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average \nmaturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio \nremained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is \nrelatively high at above 80 percent.     \nQatar has started to implement the ambitious Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) to \nbuild a more diversified, knowledge-based and private sector-driven economy. Guided by \nNDS3, reform momentum has strengthened significantly, including to attract and retain high-\nskilled expatriate workers, foster innovation, promote public-private partnerships, and further \nimprove the business efficiency. Qatar is well positioned to leverage digitalization and AI for \nproductivity gains, and the nation’s climate agenda is advancing.  \nRisks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Main downside risks stem from the global \nheadwinds, including a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in \nglobal financial conditions and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical \ntensions. The regional conflict has had limited impact on Qatar but adds further to the \ndownside risks through lower tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon \n1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff \nteam visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments \nand policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.",
